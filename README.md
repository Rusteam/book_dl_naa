# Deep Learning Tutorial from a Book

The goal of this repo is to reproduce code from a book about [Deep Learning](https://www.litres.ru/a-kadurin-13464223/glubokoe-obuchenie-pogruzhenie-v-mir-neyronnyh-29817855/) written by S.Nikolenko, A.Kadurin, and Y.Arkhangelskaya.

The expirements will be implemented in Jupyter notebooks. Reporting on different configurations are inside the notebooks.

### Notebooks

1. Mutli-class classification on MNIST data using only fully-connected model architecture. Reached over 98% accuracy. Both tensorflow and pytorch.
2. Multi-class classification on MNIST and CIFAR-10 using convolutional networks. Reached over 99% accuracy on mnist and almost 75% accuracy on cifar.
3. Autoencoder using fully-connected layers on mnist.
